# NixOS Compose

The goal of NixOS-Compose is to reduce the burden of setting up _ephemeral_ distributed systems thanks to [Nix](https://nixos.org) functional package manager and [Nixos](https://nixos.org)

The main common use cases are:
- Testing/developing for different targets (vm, container, baremetal).
- Rapid Infrastructure as Code prototyping.
- Evaluating and Benchmarking w/ reproducibility guarantee.
- Advanced experiment for research studies in DS, HPC, Cloud/Edge/Fog, ...

The NixOS-Compose project takes inspiration and code from [NixOS Tests](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-nixos-tests), [nixos-generators](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-generators) and [Arion](https://github.com/hercules-ci/arion).
